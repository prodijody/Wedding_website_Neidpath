A brief description of the venue: "Perched proudly beside the River Tweed in the Scottish Borders, Neidpath Castle has stood since the 14th century—its thick walls echoing with centuries of regal visits, romantic tales, and a ghost or two! Once a key stronghold of the powerful Hay family, it welcomed Mary, Queen of Scots, endured Cromwell’s cannons, and inspired writers like Sir Walter Scott. Legend whispers of the tragic “Maid of Neidpath,” whose spirit roams its winding halls to this day. With its soaring tower, ivy-clad walls, and timeless views of rolling hills, Neidpath offers a uniquely enchanting setting—perfect for a wedding steeped in Scottish history and filled with stories your guests will never forget."
